# Typescript React Example: Loan Pre-Qualification App

## Purpose
This app was created to demonstrate how to build a small application using react, redux and typescript

## Choices made

### Bootstrap
I added bootstrap to the project so I didn't have to spend too much time being fussy about styling things

### Redux 
I originally just used the useState hook to manage application state but I ended up deciding to go with redux because it was starting to get a little bloated in my component.

### Api
I decided to just export a function that wrapped the qualification functionality in a promise rather than try and get too fancy with mocking out a rest client. I thought about going ahead and adding a `post` method for the qualification form and a `get` method to return the marketing message, but I decided that wasn't necessary

### DIY Validation Library
I decided to handle validating form elements myself instead of going with an off the shelf library (e.g. [formik](https://formik.org/) or [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)). Even though I think my solution ended up working pretty good, this ended up being the biggest time sink, so I would definitely use an off the shelf solution in the future.

## Build and Run 

Clone the repo and cd into it
Runt `npm install` to install dependencies.
Then run `npm run buildAndServe`
This will build the app for production and then use serve to setup a static server on port 5000 from the build directory. Once this completes you should be able to point your browser at
[http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000);

## Other Available Scripts
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and as such all the available scripts generated by that project.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
